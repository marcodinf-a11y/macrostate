# MMT Economic Simulation Game

An open source economic simulation game that models [Modern Monetary Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory) (MMT) ideas through gameplay. Players take the role of a sovereign currency-issuing government, setting fiscal policy and observing how money flows through the economy.

## Vision

A Victoria 3-inspired real-time economic simulation where the underlying economic model is built on MMT rather than mainstream economics. Players learn MMT concepts — not through lectures, but by experiencing how a sovereign currency system actually works.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Sovereign currency mechanics** — money is created by government spending and destroyed by taxation
- **Agent-based economy** — households, firms, and banks interact to produce emergent economic behavior
- **Job Guarantee** — implement MMT's signature policy proposal as an automatic stabilizer
- **Sectoral balances** — observe how government, private, and foreign sector balances interact
- **Real resource constraints** — inflation arises from spending beyond productive capacity, not from "printing money"
- **Multiple economies** — AI-controlled nations with their own monetary systems react to your policies
- **Geographic provinces** — 2D top-down map with regions, resources, and populations
- **Scenario-based objectives** — guided challenges alongside sandbox experimentation

## Tech Stack

- **Engine:** [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (open source, MIT licensed)
- **Language:** C#
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS

## Modding

The game is designed for modding from day one. All game data lives in external JSON files — the base game itself loads through the same system mods use.

- **Data mods** — tweak economic parameters, add sectors/goods/scenarios via JSON. No code required.
- **Plugin mods** — extend game mechanics, add new agent types, custom AI, new UI panels via C# plugins.
- **Combinable** — multiple mods with dependency resolution and load ordering.

See [docs/MODDING.md](docs/MODDING.md) for the full modding architecture.

## Current Status

**Requirements gathering phase.** See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the game design document, [docs/MVP.md](docs/MVP.md) for the MVP scope, and [docs/ECONOMIC-MODEL.md](docs/ECONOMIC-MODEL.md) for the simulation model.
