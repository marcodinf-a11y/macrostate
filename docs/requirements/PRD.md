### 1.2 Goals

1. Provide an engaging economic simulation where MMT dynamics emerge naturally from gameplay
2. Let players experience sovereign currency mechanics firsthand
3. Be detailed enough for university-level educational use
4. Support modding from day one
5. Be fully open source

### 1.3 Target Audience

### 2.14 Testability Contract

Every simulation-engine functional requirement group must be covered by automated tests. Presentation-layer FR groups (FR-UI, FR-CON, FR-GMD, FR-CTL-002) use manual verification for Godot-specific behavior, with automated tests where the logic is separable from the engine (e.g., command parsing, scenario win/lose detection). See `docs/technical/UI-TESTING-ROADMAP.md` for the path toward full automated UI testing.

Tests follow the naming convention:

```
[RequirementId]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]
```

Examples:
- `FrSim001_AfterGovernmentSpending_SfcIdentityHolds`
- `FrPrc001_WageRiseWithProductivityGain_NoPriceIncrease`
- `FrMod001_MissingRequiredField_ProducesClearError`

#### Test Coverage Mapping

- Each agent type must be independently testable
- Zero Godot dependencies enforced at the project level (`Simulation.csproj` must not reference Godot assemblies)
- All agents receive dependencies via constructor injection (`IDataProvider`, `ILedger`)
- An `InMemoryDataProvider` must exist for tests, allowing data to be registered in memory instead of read from disk
- The simulation must be constructable and runnable headlessly (no UI, no Godot, pure C#)
- All randomness must use a seeded `IRandom` interface for deterministic, reproducible tests

#### NFR-CQA-003: Test-Driven Development Methodology
- All simulation engine code must be developed using TDD (red-green-refactor cycle)
- Every public method must have a corresponding test written before its implementation
- Each FR-* requirement must be traceable to at least one automated test
- Every bug fix must include a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after

#### NFR-CQA-004: Test Coverage and Categories
- Minimum 80% line coverage for the simulation engine
- Three test categories:
  - **Unit tests:** isolated component tests (single class, mocked dependencies)
  - **Integration tests:** full tick cycles, money flow end-to-end, policy-to-outcome chains
  - **Property-based tests:** SFC invariants hold for arbitrary inputs, no negative prices, employment rate in [0, 1]
- A headless simulation test harness must support multi-year runs (100+ ticks) without Godot

#### NFR-CQA-005: Data Validation Testing
- JSON schema validation must run at load time for all data files
- Tests must verify that all base game data files (`data/base/`) are valid and complete
- Tests must verify that malformed data produces clear, actionable error messages

- The scenario mode must provide enough context for a player to understand the objective without external documentation

#### NFR-USA-002: Feedback Clarity
- The relationship between policy changes and economic outcomes must be visible through the UI (charts, pipeline indicators)
- The player must never be confused about what their policy changes are doing

## 4. MVP Definition of Done

The MVP is complete when:

1. **SFC accounting works** — all transactions are double-entry; balances always sum to zero
2. **Two money circuits visible** — reserves and deposits tracked and displayable
3. **Policy controls work** — player can adjust spending, allocation, and tax rate
4. **Money circuit flows** — government spending creates currency; taxation destroys it
5. **Production runs** — firms produce based on profit-driven decisions; households consume via AIDS demand system
6. **Labor market functions** — firms post wages, households accept/reject, unemployment emerges naturally
7. **Bank lending works** — banks create money via loans; repayments destroy it
8. **Bond auctions work** — government issues bonds; banks bid; CB backstops
9. **Inflation responds correctly** — driven by unit labor costs and demand pressure, not raw spending
10. **Charts update live** — all key indicators chart in real-time
11. **Scenario playable** — one scenario with win/lose conditions completable
12. **Sandbox works** — free experimentation mode with full dashboard
13. **Pause and speed controls work** — player can control simulation flow

## 5. Out of Scope (MVP)

The following are explicitly not part of the MVP:

| Feature | Reason for deferral |
|---|---|
| Job Guarantee program | Build basic employment dynamics first |
| Foreign sector / trade / sectoral balances (3-sector) | Requires foreign sector |
| Multiple economies / AI nations | Focus on domestic dynamics first |
| Multiple provinces / geographic map gameplay | One province proves the economic model |
| Individual agent simulation (population groups only) | Population groups sufficient for MVP |
| Monetary policy (CB rate changes) | CB rate fixed at 0 in MVP |
| Multiple tax types | Single income tax; progressive/sales/wealth taxes later |
| Bond secondary market | No resale in MVP |
| Multiple competing banks | Single aggregate bank in MVP |
| Bank insolvency / systemic crisis mechanics | Defaults tracked but no systemic crisis modeling |
| Collective bargaining / wage contracts | Simple wage posting only |
| 5+ household classes or continuous income spectrum | 3 classes in MVP; continuous spectrum later |
| Sub-sector hierarchy | 4 top-level sectors sufficient for MVP; sub-sector expansion post-MVP |
| Mod loader / mod management UI | Data-driven JSON modding sufficient for MVP |
| Plugin API for code mods | Data-driven JSON modding sufficient for MVP |
| Multiplayer | Single-player focus for MVP |
| Tutorial / guided onboarding | Sandbox and scenario modes provide sufficient onboarding |
| Save/load game state | Deterministic simulation + short sessions; full state serialization deferred to post-MVP (high priority) |
| Sound / music | Gameplay mechanics first; polish later |
| Localization | English only for MVP |
