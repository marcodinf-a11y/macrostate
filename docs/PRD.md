# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product

An open source, single-player economic simulation game built on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). The player governs a sovereign currency-issuing nation, setting fiscal policy and observing how money flows through a stock-flow consistent economy.

### 1.2 Goals

1. Provide an engaging economic simulation where MMT dynamics emerge naturally from gameplay
2. Let players experience sovereign currency mechanics firsthand
3. Be detailed enough for university-level educational use
4. Support modding from day one
5. Be fully open source

### 1.3 Target Audience

| Persona | Description | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **The Curious Gamer** | Enjoys simulation/strategy games (Victoria 3, Democracy 4, Factorio). Interested in economics but not an expert. | Fun gameplay loop, clear feedback, gradual learning curve |
| **The Economics Student** | Studying economics at university. Wants to see MMT concepts in action, not just in textbooks. | Accurate model, inspectable internals, ability to test theories |
| **The Modder** | Wants to extend the game — new scenarios, new mechanics, total conversions. | Clean data format, extensible architecture, documentation |
| **The MMT Enthusiast** | Already understands MMT. Wants a tool to demonstrate concepts to others. | Correct implementation of MMT, visible accounting identities, scenario creation |

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Simulation Engine

#### FR-SIM-001: Stock-Flow Consistent Accounting
- The simulation must use double-entry bookkeeping for all financial transactions
- Every monetary flow must have an explicit source and destination
- The accounting identity (Government balance + Private balance = 0) must hold every tick
- An SFC consistency check must be runnable at any time and must pass

#### FR-SIM-002: Two Money Circuits
- The simulation must track central bank money (reserves) and deposit money (bank deposits) as separate layers
- Government spending must flow: Treasury → bank reserves → recipient deposits
- Taxation must flow: deposits → reserves → Treasury (destruction)
- The private sector must only interact with deposit money
- The central bank and Treasury must only interact with reserve money

#### FR-SIM-003: Monthly Tick Processing
- Each simulation tick represents one month

- The simulation must calculate and expose at minimum:
  - Employment rate, unemployment rate
  - Inflation rate (price level change)
